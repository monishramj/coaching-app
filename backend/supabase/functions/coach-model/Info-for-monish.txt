What is done:
- coach.ts which is the entrypoint to this edge function. It is called whenever a coach is created and it saves the info of that
coach into the db

What you need to do:
In supabase, the "coach" table is where all ts is handled
Add a "name" column for the name the user can give to the coach 
Add a "created by" column which holds the uuid (type is uuid) of the user who created it
Make sure to update coach.ts such that the created by and name rows are also updated. You can assume that the json file that 
coach.ts recieves contains all data needed.

Again in supabase, add a "published" column of booleans which tracks if user chose to publish their choach (still in the coach table)
RLS or row level security is enabled for the table so you need to write a policy in SQL which basically says
"Users can only read their own data, unless this boolean column of published is true in which case all users can read the
row which is marked as true"

The sql function will be written in supabase in the sql editor (found in left menu)
---------------------------
Also add a delete-coach.ts to.. delete the coach from db if user desires. Ofc only the creator can delete.
(no automatic delete yet, keep it simple, coach only deletes if creator deletes)
---------------------------
Next, idk how you choose to do this, whether adding onto this edge function or creating a new one but:

High level pipeline for marketplace:
Frontend asks backend to display marketplace
Backend searches through coach table and finds all rows for which "published" is true and sends to frontend the name, creator and coachid
Frontend can display name of coach and created by as part of UI and when anyone chooses to "download" or use a coach, we can tell what coach
they chose to use because when they click the coach, frontend will quiery backend with the coachID


=========================================
Bonus:
If you have time after all this (else ill take care of it.. maybe depending on where I, Adarsh, am with things)
Rn we can create coaches but if the creator choose to update it after creation its.. not possible so smth like an
update-coach.ts that says if the coach exists and the person making the update quiery is the creator then we update instructions
