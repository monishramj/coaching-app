RLS is enabled and it is creator only unless this column (the marketplace column) is public in which case all users can read all. Except for the userid of creator.

Only the creator can update the fact that its public or private|

Keep tabs on how things with coach is going:
I have not figured out exactly how to do this, but if the coach is marked public, everyone has read access to it which is fine
but we need to make it so only the creator can modify it.. and also if there is some way to hide uuid specifically from everyone
without making it difficult for backend to tell if the user has perms to use the coach.

In future perhaps add an array called hasPerms which holds uuid of all who have access to it (works if they need to buy the model)
if we add this, would need to ensure that if someone who downloaded it off market tries to delete it then only their local instance disappears

Coaches are not updatable once created.. hm might have to create an update coach.ts

ToDo
for memory storage, expect a coach input also and store mempories per coach
actually write the gemini instructions for memoy, retrieval and core
finish history
